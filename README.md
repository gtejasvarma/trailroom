# Trailroom

Try fashion products without leaving your couch. One photo of you, and every piece
from the labels you follow comes back on your body — in four poses (Front, Three-quarter,
Walking, Seated) — before you buy.

**Where it stands.** The product is being built to match two prototypes, as a single responsive web
app. V0 is a demonstration on Friday 9 October 2026 (the first three phases of the build plan:
catalogue and Discover, photos and capture, and the queue, account and result). Email is designed
but not sent in V0.

## What's here

| Path | What it is |
|---|---|
| `docs/PRD.md` | **The PRD** (v0.7), one consistent document. §22 holds the decisions and their reasoning; §19 is the register of the original mock-vs-PRD audit. |
| `docs/Design.md` | **The design system of record.** Colour, type, space, motion, components, anti-patterns. Derive every value from §11 and do not invent tokens. |
| `docs/BUILD_PLAN.md` | How the PRD becomes shipped code. §12 is the current plan (Phases A to H, with V0 = A to C). |
| `docs/DEPLOY.md` | The manual deploy runbook (Tejas runs it; agents do not deploy). |
| `docs/decisions/` | ADRs — one file per irreversible call (infra, vendor, architecture, scope). |
| `specs/` | Units of work — one spec file per increment being built. |
| `mocks/` | The two aligned, runnable prototypes (the visual specification), their images and screenshots, and two reference files. |
| `packages/`, `apps/web/`, `workflows/` | The render chokepoint, database layer, pipeline, catalogue, eval harness, and the Next.js app. |
| `archive/` | Superseded documents and mocks, and the verbatim source of the two linked prototype artifacts. Provenance, not guidance. |

## Running the prototypes

Open `mocks/Trailroom Prototype.dc.html` (mobile) or `mocks/Trailroom Desktop.dc.html` (desktop)
directly in a browser. Images are in `mocks/assets/`; reference screenshots are in `mocks/screens/`.
They are the target prototypes with the PRD §22.1 decisions applied (no fit sentences, a consent line
under the upload controls, Google sign-in only, no promise of email).

- `mocks/Trailroom Desktop Designer.dc.html` — the designer back office, a reference for a deferred
  milestone.
- `mocks/Conversion Audit.dc.html` — a 44-item audit of an earlier prototype.
- `mocks/support.js` is a standalone runtime written for this repo so `.dc.html` files run outside
  the Claude Design canvas. `mocks/support.canvas.js` is the real canvas export, reference only.

The two linked prototype artifacts the product was aligned to, and their extracted source, are
listed in `archive/prototypes-2026-10-07/README.md`.

## Where the decisions live

Every non-obvious call is written down with its reasoning, so it can be re-litigated with the
argument in view:

- **PRD §22** — the v0.7 realignment: the 18 decisions in §22.1, V0, and what is not being built
- **PRD §19–21** — the original audit, the imported design documents, and the signup and result
  decisions as they stand now
- **`docs/decisions/`** — ADRs, including 0004 (build order, QA gate) and 0005 (realign to the
  prototypes)
